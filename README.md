# Nomads Travel Blog

## 1. Definition Problem:

The objective is to design a travel blog application that allows users to create, edit, and delete their own posts. Each user should have exclusive access to their own posts, without being able to view publications made by other users. Additionally, the application should allow all users, regardless of login status, to view and comment posts created by any user.

## 2. Project Goal:

Create a platform where travelers can share their journeys, insights, and recommendations, as well as leave comments on each post. The platform should prioritize easy navigation and be responsive across various devices.

## 3. Technologies I've used:

- Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process
- GitHub was used to store the project.
- PostgreSQL was used as the relational database.
- Django is the framework used to write models, classes and templates .
- Pep8 was used for formatting and error-checking Python code.
- Crispyforms were used to display forms.
- Google fonts are used to add fonts for aesthetic and UX purposes
- Responsive CSS was implemented using Bootstrap 5.
