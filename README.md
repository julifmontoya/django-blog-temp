# Nomads Travel Blog

## 1. Definition Problem

The objective is to design a travel blog application that allows users to create, edit, and delete their own posts. Each user should have exclusive access to their own posts, without being able to view publications made by other users. Additionally, the application should allow all users, regardless of login status, to view and comment posts created by any user.

## 2. Project Goal
Create a platform where travelers can share their journeys, insights, and recommendations, as well as leave comments on each post. The platform should prioritize easy navigation and be responsive across various devices.

## 3. Technologies I've used
- GitHub was used to store the project.
- Visual Studio Code was my choice of IDE.
- PostgreSQL was used as the relational database.
- Django is the framework used to write models, classes and templates .
- Pep8 was used for formatting and error-checking Python code.
- Crispyforms were used to display forms.
- Responsive CSS was implemented using Bootstrap 5.

#### Desktop Testing:
I thoroughly tested all aspects of the site on this browser, and I am pleased to report that everything functions flawlessly. Pages load swiftly, and all features, including CRUD operations, user authentication (login/logout), register process, trips addition, and category filter work without any issues.
